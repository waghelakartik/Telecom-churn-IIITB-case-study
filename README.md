# Telecom-churn-IIITB-case-study

This repository contains the code, presentation slides, and README.md file for predicting telecom customer churn using data analytics techniques. The project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify potential churn customers and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Files Included

1. **Telecom churn.ipynb**: This Python file contains the code for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and recommendation generation.

2. **Predicting Telecom Customer Churn in Indian and Southeast Asian Markets.pdf**: This PDF file consists of presentation slides summarizing the project, including the business objective, data analysis approach, model evaluation, and recommendations for managing customer churn effectively.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

- **Understanding the Business Objective and the Data**: Exploring customer behavior during churn and defining the business objective of predicting churn in the ninth month using data from the preceding three months.

- **Data Preparation**: Filtering high-value customers based on recharge amount, tagging churners, and removing attributes of the churn phase. 

- **Modelling Approach**: Building predictive models for churn prediction using techniques like Lasso, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Evaluating model performance and identifying important predictor attributes.

- **Model Evaluation and Recommendations**: Assessing model performance, visualizing important predictor attributes, and providing recommendations for managing customer churn based on observed insights.

To replicate the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
2. Open and run the `Telecom churn.ipynb` file in your Python environment.
